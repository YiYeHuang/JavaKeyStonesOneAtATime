/**
 * Given an array of 2n integers, your task is to group these integers into n pairs of integer, 
 * say (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn) which makes sum of min(ai, bi) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.
 * Example 1:
 * Input: [1,4,3,2]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: n is 2, and the maximum sum of pairs is 4.

    /**
     *In order to understand this approach, let us look at the problem from a different perspective.
     * We need to form the pairings of the array's elements such that the overall sum of the minimum out of such pairings is maximum.
     * Thus, we can look at the operation of choosing the minimum out of the pairing,
     * say (a, b)(a,b) as incurring a loss of a - baâˆ’b(if a> ba>b),
     *
     * in the maximum sum possible.
     * in the maximum sum possible.
     *
     * The total sum will now be maximum if the overall loss incurred from such pairings is minimized.
     * This minimization of loss in every pairing is possible only if the numbers chosen for the pairings lie closer to each other than to the other elements of the array.
     *
     * Taking this into consideration, we can sort the elements of the given array and form the pairings of the elements
     * directly in the sorted order. This will lead to the pairings of elements with minimum difference between them leading to the maximization of the required sum.
     *
     *
     * minimum the lost of pair (a, b) a - b, so basically choose number 1, 3, 5, 7 .....
